# PART 1 HTML, CSS & JavaScript Code Challenge

In this challenge, I will be implementing a simple navigation menu using HTML5 and CSS3

## Create a Git Repository
* Create a new repository called 'HTML_CSS_JS_Code_Challenge'
* Clone the the repository into my Local Machine
* Work on the Local Machine;
* Use git add -A, git commit - m "commit ****" and git push to add, commit and push created files to git. 

## Create HTML file (using HTML5)
* Create a file called 'index html'
* In index.html, use HTML5 elements to mark up the structure, with an article element to contain everything.

### Groundwork Layout
I will now lay the groundwork for my markup order: Ensuring that the design will be useable with styles and images turned off. This will involve creating content page with four sections;
1. The logo and Icon Section
2. Website Title and Headline Section
3. A Section containing an article and Navlinks
4. A side Section containing More Links

### Flushing out the Layout
Here I will structure the content created in a usable way using CSS3
1. Create an asset folder and:
 * Create an image subfolder that will hold all the images produced in this exercise
 * Create a CSS subfolder and a file 'styles.css' and save it in the assets folder the css sheet will contain all the styles used to manipulate the static page
 * insert style.css as an external style sheet in the html file

2. Create the first row (with class name mainRow) containing the first block of four sections (with class name subRow) and one block for more links (with class name moreLks)
 * Use the css to divide mainRow into two blocks (with class names subRow and moreLks and float them to left)
 * Within the class subRow class, create 3 rows consisting of the logo/icon secrion, the Title/headline section, and the Article/Navlink section

 * Use the css to divide each of the subRows into four blocks and float them to left

 * Use Margin to create spaces between the rows

 We now have a simple layout that closely resembles the mockup
