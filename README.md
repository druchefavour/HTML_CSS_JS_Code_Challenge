# PART 1 HTML, CSS & JavaScript Code Challenge

In this challenge, I will be implementing a simple navigation menu using HTML5 and CSS3

## Create a Git Repository
* Create a new repository called 'HTML_CSS_JS_Code_Challenge'
* Clone the the repository into my Local Machine
* Work on the Local Machine;
* Use git add -A, git commit - m "commit ****" and git push to add, commit and push created files to git. 

## Create HTML file (using HTML5)
* Create a file called 'index html'
* In index.html, use HTML5 elements to mark up the structure, with an article element to contain everything.

### I will now lay the groundwork for my markup order: Ensuring that the design will be useable with styles and images turned off.
