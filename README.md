# PART 1 HTML, CSS & JavaScript Code Challenge

In this challenge, I will be implementing a simple navigation menu using HTML5 and CSS3

## Create a Git Repository
* Create a new repository called 'HTML_CSS_JS_Code_Challenge'
* Clone the the repository into my Local Machine
* Work on the Local Machine;
* Use git add -A, git commit - m "commit ****" and git push to add, commit and push created files to git. 

## Create HTML file (using HTML5)
* Create a file called 'index html'
* In index.html, use HTML5 elements to mark up the structure, with an article element to contain everything.

### Groundwork Layout
I will now lay the groundwork for my markup order: Ensuring that the design will be useable with styles and images turned off. This will involve creating content page with four sections;
1. The logo and Icon Section
2. Website Title and Headline Section
3. A Section containing an article and Navlinks
4. A side Section containing More Links

### Flushing out the Layout
Here I will structure the content created in a usable way using CSS3
1. Create an asset folder and:
 * Create an image subfolder that will hold all the images produced in this exercise
 * Create a CSS subfolder and a file 'styles.css' and save it in the assets folder the css sheet will contain all the styles used to manipulate the static page


3. Create the Navlinks using unordered and ordered listing
